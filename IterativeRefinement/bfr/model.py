class Model:
    """ A bfr model

    Attributes
    ----------
    eucl_threshold : float
        Nearness of a point and a cluster is determined by
        Euclidean distance(point,cluster) < eucl_threshold

    merge_threshold : float
        Two clusters in the compress set will be merged if their merged standard deviation
        is less than or equal to (std_dev(cluster) + std_dev(other_cluster)) * merge_threshold.

    init_rounds : int
        Higher integer numbers give better spread of the initial points

    dimensions : int
        The dimensionality of the model

    nof_clusters : int
        The number of clusters (eg. K)

    threshold_fun : function
        The current default function for determining if a point and a cluster
        are considered close. The function should accept a point and a cluster
        and return a float.

    threshold : float
        The current default threshold used by the model. Should point to eucl_threshold when the
        current threshold_fun is Euclidean. Should point to mahal_threshold when the threshold_fun
        is mahalanobis.

    distance_fun : function
        The current default function for finding the closest cluster of a point.
        The function should accept a point and a cluster and return a float

    mahal_threshold : float
        Nearness of point and cluster is determined by
        mahalanobis distance < mahalanobis_factor * sqrt(dimensions)

    discard : list
        The discard set holds all the clusters. A point will update a cluster
        (and thus be discarded) if it is considered near the cluster.

    compress : list
        The compression set holds clusters of points which are near to each other
        but not near enough to be included in a cluster of the discard set

    retain : list
        Contains uncompressed outliers which are neither near to other points nor a cluster

    initialized : bool
        True if initialization phase has been completed, false otherwise.
